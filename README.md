## Run code locally

- First, you need to set up [Python environment in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)

- Make sure you use __Python 3.6 - 3.9__ as for now, TensorFlow has not officially supported newer versions of Python.

- Next, inside the Python environment of your choice that you've set up in VS Code, install project dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Other helpful commands

- Check Python version
    ```
    python3 --version
    ```

- Check TensorFlow version
    ```
    pip3 show tensorflow
    ```
